#' Male Yellow-breasted boubous were recorded in Bamenda region in Cameroon.
#' Birds were recorded between 06.00 to 10.00 in the morning in 2016, typically,
#' from the distance of 10 - 20 meters. The calls were recorded after short
#' provocation with playback. Repertoire of males at the field site included
#' three distinct call types and only the most common call typed labeled as
#' “High wee woo” was used for this study. The original dataset comprised 33
#' individuals and 10 calls per individual. \cr\cr
#' Variables were selected to measure basic spectral parameters of each “high
#' weewoo” call like the peak frequency, distribution of frequency amplitudes
#' within spectrum, and range of the frequencies (minimum and maximum).
#' Additionally, the duration of the call was measured. Variables were extracted
#' in Raven Pro 1.5 by the Cornell Bioacoustic Research Program.
