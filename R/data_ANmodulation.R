#' Calls of little owls were collected in Czech Republic and Hungary.
#' Territorial calls of each male were recorded for three minutes after a short
#' playback provocation (1 min) inside their territories from up to 50 m
#' distance from the individuals. The recordings were made during comparable,
#' favourable meteorological conditions (without strong wind or precipitation),
#' from sunset until midnight between March and April of 2013 and 2014. This period
#' covered the mating season. The period and the time of the day for recording
#' were selected with regard to the peak in vocal activity of little owls both
#' within a day and within a season. The original dataset included 54 males with
#' more than 20 calls each (20-41 calls per individual, mean, SD = 26.9, 6.0)
#' with good recording quality.The number of individuals and calls per
#' individual was reduced to match parameters of the other datasets.\cr\cr
#' Eleven variables were measured to describe the modulation of the fundamental
#' frequency within the call (shape of the call on spectrogram) and the duration
#' of the call. Fundamental frequency was measured at ten measuring points
#' spread equidistantly throughout the call duration. Variables were extracted
#' in SASLab Pro by Avisoft.\cr
