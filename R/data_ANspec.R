#' Calls of little owls were collected in Czech Republic and Hungary.
#' Territorial calls of each male were recorded for three minutes after a short
#' playback provocation (1 min) inside their territories from up to 50 m
#' distance from the individuals. The recordings were made during comparable,
#' favourable meteorological conditions (without strong wind or precipitation),
#' from sunset until midnight between March and April of 2013 and 2014. This period
#' covered the mating season. The period and the time of the day for recording
#' were selected with regard to the peak in vocal activity of little owls both
#' within a day and within a season. The original dataset included 54 males with
#' more than 20 calls each (20-41 calls per individual, mean, SD = 26.9, 6.0)
#' with good recording quality.The number of individuals and calls per
#' individual was reduced to match parameters of the other datasets.\cr\cr
#' Variables were selected to measure basic parameters of call spectrum
#' like the peak frequency, distribution of frequency amplitudes within
#' spectrum, and range of the frequencies (minimum and maximum). Additionally,
#' the duration of the call was measured. Variables were extracted in SASLab Pro
#' by Avisoft.
